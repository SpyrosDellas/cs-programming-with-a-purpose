 *
 * The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the
 * longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of strings or sequences
 * in general (often just two strings / sequences).
 *
 * Note:
 * The subsequence needs to maintain the order of appearance of its elements
 * within the string/sequence itself
 *
 * It differs from the longest common substring problem: unlike substrings,
 * subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the
 * original sequences.
 *
 * The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem,
 * the basis of data comparison programs such as the diff utility, and has
 * applications in computational linguistics and bioinformatics. It is also
 * widely used by revision control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple
 * changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.
 *
 * In this program we adopt a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to
 * find the solution:
 *
 * - If s and t begin with the same character, then the LCS of s and t contains
 *   that first character. Thus, our problem reduces to finding the LCS of the
 *   suffixes s[1..m) and t[1..n)
 * - If s and t begin with different characters, both characters cannot be part
 *   of a common subsequence, so can safely discard one or the other. In either
 *   case, the problem reduces to finding the LCS of two stringsâ€”either
 *   s[0..m) and t[1..n) or s[1..m) and t[0..n).
 *
 * The final challenge is to recover the longest common subsequence itself,
 * not just its length. The key idea is to retrace the steps of the dynamic
 * programming algorithm backward, rediscovering the path of choices.
