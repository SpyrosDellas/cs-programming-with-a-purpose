 * Introduction:
 * A walker begins walking aimlessly. At each time step, she takes one step
 * in a random direction (either north, east, south, or west), each with
 * probability 25%. She stops once she is at 'Manhattan' distance r from the
 * starting point. How many steps will the random walker take?
 *
 * This process is known as a two-dimensional random walk.
 *
 * It is a discrete version of a natural phenomenon known as Brownian motion.
 * It serves as a scientific model for an astonishing range of physical
 * processes from the dispersion of ink flowing in water, to the formation
 * of polymer chains in chemistry, to cascades of neurons firing in the brain.
 *
 * This program takes two integer command-line arguments r and trials.
 * In each of trials independent experiments, it simulates a random walk until #
 * the random walker is at 'Manhattan' distance r from the starting point.
 * It then prints the average number of steps.
 *
 * As r increases, we expect the random walker to take more and more steps.
 * But how many more steps?
 * We use RandomWalkers.java to formulate a hypothesis as to how the average
 * number of steps grows as a function of r.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Estimating an unknown quantity by generating random samples and aggregating
 * the results is an example of Monte Carlo simulation â€” a powerful
 * computational technique that is used widely in statistical physics,
 * computational finance, and computer graphics.
