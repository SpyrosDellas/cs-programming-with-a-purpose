 * Maximum square submatrix:
 * Given an n-by-n matrix of 0s and 1s, find a contiguous square submatrix of
 * maximum size that contains only 1s
 *
 * - Size. The size of a square submatrix is its number of rows (or columns).
 * We assume that the argument to the size() method is a square matrix
 * containing only 0s and 1s.
 * - Contiguous. The square submatrix must be contiguousâ€”the row indicies must
 * be consecutive and the column indices must be consecutive.
 * - Performance. The size() method should take time proportional to n^2 in the
 * worst case.
 * - Input format. Standard input will contain a positive integer n, followed
 * by n lines, with each line containing n 0s and 1s, separated by whitespace.
 *
 * Note:
 * The maximum square submatrix problem is related to problems that arise in
 * databases, image processing, and maximum likelihood estimation. It is also
 * a popular technical job interview question.
